# Getting Started


## Access the system

By default there is a webserver at port `8080` that redirects to the compiled **next.js** app on port `4000` and the compiled **api** on port `4001` and the compiled **core** on port `3002`.

Once the Next.js app is running you can go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the web app. 

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout>
  If you have problems accessing the services, remember to check your firewall configuration.

## 🙋‍♂️ Adding a user
The first time you run the starter you won't have users. You can easily create one by registering throught the interface at `http://localhost:8080/auth/register`, but this one will be a normal user. 

If you want to create an admin user you can do it using CLI by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add-user user@email.com password admin
# yarn add-user [your-email] [your-password] [user-type]
```

Or if you started with **Docker**: 

```bash
cd docker
./add-user
```

We've just created a user with `admin` type!

## 🛠️ Building and Customizing your Project
The **admin panel** is the place that allow you to customize your aplication and services there you can create and manage your system entities, like pages, apis, devices, users, objects, etc...
