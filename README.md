<p align="center">AI Supercharged LowCode Platform CMS and Framework</p> 

![visual-ui-gif](https://github.com/Protofy-xyz/Protofy/blob/assets/visualui/visualui-2.gif?raw=true)

Protofy is a Full-Stack, batteries included Low-Code enabled web/app and IoT system with an API system and real time messaging.

You can use this as a base to fast prototype Apps, webs, IoT systems, automations or APIs.
Based on: Protofy (protoflow + visualui + protolib + protodevices) + Expo + Next.js + Tamagui + Solito + Express + Aedes + Many other amazing packages

You can think of **Protofy** as a Wordpress but based in **react** and **javascript** and some features from supabase, plus visual widget editors to edit source code inside the admin panel itself and a a visual editor for react pages (wysiwyg).

A ultra-extensible CMS with supercharged capabilities, mobile support and IoT support (esp32 thanks to esphome).

Check the [getting started](docs/getting-started.md) guide to run Protofy on your computer, directly with npm or using docker.
